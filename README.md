# Using Deno.serve() with web components


This repo shows an example of how to use `Deno.serve()` to serve HTML files containing web components.

To run the server in a [Deno](https://deno.com) runtime, invoke the following: 
```
deno task dev
```
The application will then be available at http://localhost:8080
